test_new_syscall has been added to the Makefile.

after typing "make" the executable "test" will be created.

then to use run_test.sh, you need to add ./adb to your path.

to add ./adb to PATH:
copy the code below into ~/.bashrc

export PATH=$PATH:~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools

and then type: source ~/.bashrc

Now you can run_test.sh

If you don't want to add to path, then just run what is in
run_test.sh manually. Its only intent is to speed up the process.
